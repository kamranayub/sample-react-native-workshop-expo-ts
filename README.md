# React Native Expo Frontend Masters Workshop (TypeScript)

This is my lab playground written in TypeScript for [Kadi Kraman's React Native Frontend Masters workshop](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/). I am using the Expo-based version, with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Follow the workshop's [expo guide](https://kadikraman.github.io/react-native-v2/setup-expo) to ensure you have prerequisites installed and then:

    yarn
    yarn start

## Notes

- Using a `tokens.ts` styles helper
- Using `@react-navigation` typings like `CompositeNavigationProp` and `StackNavigationProp`
- Using `<Button />` in a couple places instead of `<TouchableOpacity />`
- All the components and screens are statically-typed
